# Agent-Based Modeling in the Design and Management of Circular Marine Tourism Economy 

This repository contains the NetLogo implementation of the Circular Economy (CE) model designed to analyze environmental and economic sustainability in circular tourism. The model simulates the performance of linear and circular management strategies in coastal tourism, focusing on waste management, pollution control, and the balance between operational costs and visitor attraction. It highlights the advantages of circular approaches in maintaining long-term environmental stability while achieving higher income sustainability.
